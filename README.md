# Credit Card Scraper
This program is used to scrape credit card information (reward earning, annual fee, initial spending bonus) from this
website: https://creditcards.usnews.com/cards. This program was implemented using JavaScript along with Node.js. Packages
used include axios and cheerio.

## Explanation
Credit cards can be a crucial component in building credit and may carry additional perks like cash rewards and points
towards flights, but they can also act as an entry point into overspending, debt and high interest. Using a credit card
responsibly is one of the best ways to build a strong credit historyâ€”something that can help you score the most favorable
rates on big loans for cars and mortgages, pay less for insurance, get access to more housing options and more. In other
words, building good credit with the help of a credit card can save you a lot of money over time. While there are numerous
benefits linked to credit cards, they can hurt your credit and lead to debt if mismanaged or used for overspending.
